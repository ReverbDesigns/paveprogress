<p>UI and UX developer with an Associates in Integrated Dynamic Web Media from the Art Institute. With several years of experience developing not just logos, but branding identities, the value of an top to bottom chemistry of code and interface is something I'm keenly aware of. Through analytics integration and campaigns on social media and email, I have learned the importance of verifying ideas with hard data. Advance skill sets in the full adobe suite, my next step in to become the full-stack developer, a developer with insights into every level of a project. Through the completion of UC Berkeley Ext Full-Stack Bootcamp, I intend to combine my experience of UI & branding with the end to end skillset of a MERN Developer.</p>
